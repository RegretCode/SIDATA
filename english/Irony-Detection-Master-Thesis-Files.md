**Description**: Files related to the "Automated Moderation: Detecting Irony in a Norwegian Facebook Comment Section using a Longformer Transformer Model with a Context Encoded Dataset" master thesis.

## Methods
- **Model**: 
  - Longformer Transformer Model: A transformer-based model for handling long sequences, tailored to detect irony in Facebook comment sections.
  - **Context Encoded Dataset**: Dataset includes context encoding to enhance the modelâ€™s understanding of irony within conversation threads.
  
- **Approach**: 
  - Automated moderation using advanced machine learning techniques for detecting irony in comments.
  - **Data Processing**: Textual data from Facebook comments is pre-processed before being fed into the model.
  
## Results
- The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics for classification.
- Results focus on accuracy and ability to detect subtle irony in conversational contexts, particularly within Norwegian-language datasets.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: 
  - The dataset consists of **Norwegian Facebook comments**, with an emphasis on ironic comments.
  - **Context Encoding**: The dataset incorporates conversation threads to provide additional context to the model.
  
- **Data Processing**: Pre-processing is required to clean and format the data before training with the Longformer model.
