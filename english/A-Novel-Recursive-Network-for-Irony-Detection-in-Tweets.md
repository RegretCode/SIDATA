**Description**: Course Project (ELEC 880 @ Queen's University)

## Project Overview
This project implements a novel recursive network for irony detection in tweets. The dataset used for training and evaluation is from the **SemEval-2018 Task 3**, which focuses on detecting irony in English tweets. The project is based on PyTorch and includes various models and training strategies.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is part of the **SemEval-2018 Task 3**. It contains English tweets labeled for irony detection.

## Dataset Usage:
The repository provides instructions on how to use the dataset with different models, including recursive networks and BERT-based models. The models can be trained by running the corresponding training scripts.

## Dataset Statistics:
Details regarding the dataset size or number of samples are not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

## Training Methods:
The project involves several approaches:
1. **Recursive Network Training**: Run the models/task3/train for the NTUA (National Technical University of Athens) implementation.
2. **BERT-based Model**: Run the `/Vandad/try-bert` script to experiment with BERT for irony detection.
3. **Embeddings**: Download NTUA embeddings from their GitHub repository and place them under the "embeddings" folder for model training.

## Results:
The results of the experiments can be found in the `/out/experiments/` folder. Specific evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are not detailed in the provided information.
