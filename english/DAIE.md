**Description**: Official implementation of the paper **"Dual-Level Adaptive Incongruity-Enhanced Model for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection"**, accepted in *Neurocomputing*.

## Project Overview
DAIE is a **multimodal sarcasm detection model** designed to process and analyze sarcasm using multiple data modalities, such as text and images.

## Training Methods:
- The model is trained on a **publicly available multimodal sarcasm detection dataset**.
- Uses **adaptive incongruity enhancement** for improved sarcasm detection.
- Requires dataset preprocessing to align with previous work.
- **Custom dataset paths** must be set in `main.py` (`DATA_PATH` and `IMG_PATH`).

## Results:
- No explicit model performance metrics or evaluation results are provided in the repository.

## Dataset:
- **Dataset is not directly included** but can be obtained from:
