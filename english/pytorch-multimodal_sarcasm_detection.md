**URL**: [https://github.com/wrk226/pytorch-multimodal_sarcasm_detection](https://github.com/wrk226/pytorch-multimodal_sarcasm_detection)

**Description**:  
This repository is the unofficial PyTorch implementation of the paper "Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter with Hierarchical Fusion Model."

## Methods
The repository provides a PyTorch implementation for detecting sarcasm in Twitter posts using a hierarchical fusion model that integrates both text and image features for multi-modal sarcasm detection.

## Results
Specific performance results or metrics are not provided in the description, but this repository is an implementation of a model described in the referenced paper.

## Dataset
The image data used in the project can be found in the official repository (TensorFlow v1 implementation) [here](https://github.com/headacheboy/data-of-multimodal-sarcasm-detection).
