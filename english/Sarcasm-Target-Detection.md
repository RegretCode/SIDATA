# Sarcasm Target Detection  
**URL**: [https://github.com/Pranav-Goel/Sarcasm-Target-Detection](https://github.com/Pranav-Goel/Sarcasm-Target-Detection)  

## Description  
This project introduces a **manually labeled dataset** for the **novel task of Sarcasm Target Identification**. It focuses on detecting **the specific subset of words in a sarcastic text** that indicate the **entity or situation being ridiculed**.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of two manually annotated files:  
- **snippets.xlsx**: Contains **224 book snippets** labeled for sarcasm targets.  
- **tweets.xlsx**: Contains **506 sarcastic tweets**, each annotated to identify sarcasm targets.  

### Annotation Scheme  
- The **sarcasm target** is a subset of words in the text that refer to the **entity or situation** being ridiculed.  
- If no target is explicitly present within the text, a fallback label of **"Outside"** is assigned.
