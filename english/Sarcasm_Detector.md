**URL**: [https://github.com/TheMoskowitz/Sarcasm_Detector](https://github.com/TheMoskowitz/Sarcasm_Detector)  

## Description  
A neural network for sarcasm detection trained on the **Reddit Sarcasm Database**.  

## Methods and Models  
- **Dataset**: Reddit Sarcasm Database  
- **Approach**: Neural network-based sarcasm detection  
- **Additional Experimentation**:  
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Attempted to use a theory that sarcastic sentences contain **both highly positive and highly negative sentiments close together**, but it did not improve results.  
  - **Larger Dataset**: No significant improvement observed despite using an expanded Reddit dataset.  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: ~57%  
  - The best academic results found were in the **60% range**.  
  - Yahoo claims to have a proprietary model with **80% accuracy**.  

## Future Improvements  
- **Contextual Analysis**: Incorporating **preceding comments** might enhance sarcasm detection.  
- **Multimodal Features**: Using **audio** could simplify the problem and significantly improve accuracy beyond **80%**.
