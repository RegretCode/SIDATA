**URL**: [https://github.com/SimranAnand1/Sarcasm-detection-in-texts-using-various-models](https://github.com/SimranAnand1/Sarcasm-detection-in-texts-using-various-models)  

## Description  
The repository focuses on detecting sarcasm in **news headlines** using NLP and deep learning techniques. The task of sarcasm detection, which is challenging due to its latent nature in text, is addressed using various models.  

## Methods and Models  
- **Models Used**:  
  1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**  
  2. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**  
  3. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
  4. **Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  5. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**  
  6. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  

- **Techniques**:  
  - Polarity scoring to discern text contexts  
  - Segregation of texts to identify sarcasm or humor  

## Results  
- No specific results or performance metrics shared.
