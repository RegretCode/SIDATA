**Description**: Code used in experiment for CLEF2022's Shared Task: Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on Twitter (IROSTEREO)

## Methods
- **Model**: 
  - The code focuses on profiling irony in Twitter posts using machine learning techniques.
  - The model aims to classify tweets as ironic or non-ironic, and to identify users spreading stereotypes.
  
- **Approach**: 
  - The experiment uses a combination of feature extraction from tweet text and machine learning models to classify and profile users.
  - Several classifiers might have been used, potentially Linear SVM, AdaBoost, Random Forest and Ensemble.
  
## Results
- The results are likely part of the CLEF2022 competition, where the focus was on profiling irony and stereotype spreaders.
- The evaluation metrics could include precision, recall, and F1 score, especially for the task of detecting irony in a large volume of social media data.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: 
  - The dataset consists of Twitter data, specifically tailored for CLEF2022's task of profiling irony and stereotype spreaders.
  - **Tweet Annotations**: Tweets are annotated with irony labels, and some tweets may also contain stereotype-related content.
  
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing may involve cleaning text data, tokenization, and transforming it into a suitable format for training machine learning models.
