**Description**: **ELMo for Irony and Sarcasm Detection**.

**Language**: Python (PyTorch), Conda.

## Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper *"Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony"* presented at **WASSA 2018**. It leverages **ELMo** for detecting irony and sarcasm in text.

## Methods
The model uses **ELMo** (Embeddings from Language Models), a deep contextualized word representation model that captures both syntax and semantics. The ELMo embeddings are integrated into the model to better capture the nuances of sarcasm and irony by incorporating the context of words in a sentence. The approach focuses on processing text data and training a model for irony and sarcasm detection using deep learning.

## Results
The repository does not specify explicit quantitative results on standard benchmarks, but it demonstrates the effectiveness of ELMo for sarcasm and irony detection, as evidenced by the paper. The performance of the model can be evaluated based on the accuracy of sarcasm prediction after training and testing on the provided Twitter dataset.
