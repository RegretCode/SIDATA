## Description  
SPIRS is a high-quality sarcasm dataset containing 15,000 sarcastic tweets and 15,000 non-sarcastic tweets, totaling 30,000 samples. The dataset was collected using a novel data capturing method called **reactive supervision**, which enables the collection of both intended and perceived sarcasm. This unique approach allows for a richer context in sarcasm detection tasks.  

### Dataset Details  
- **SPIRS** stands for **S**arcasm, **P**erceived and **I**ntended, by **R**eactive **S**upervision.  
- The dataset includes two files:
  - `SPIRS-sarcastic-ids.csv`: Contains 15,000 sarcastic tweet IDs (positive samples).
  - `SPIRS-non-sarcastic-ids.csv`: Contains 15,000 non-sarcastic tweet IDs (negative samples).  
- Additional metadata for sarcastic tweets includes:
  - Sarcasm perspective (intended or perceived).
  - Author sequence.
  - Contextual tweet IDs (cue, oblivious, and eliciting tweets).

### Key Features  
- **Reactive Supervision**: A method allowing the collection of both intended and perceived sarcasm texts.
- **Rich Context**: Includes contextual information that can help better understand sarcasm, such as author sequence and related tweets.
- **Research**: The dataset is explained in detail in the [reactive supervision paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13080), and more insights can be found in the [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-magic-of-reactive-supervision-3fc83cdb1ca4) or the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx6S-KdZ1nM).
