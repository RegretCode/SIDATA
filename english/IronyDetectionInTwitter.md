**Description**: A Simple and Accurate Neural Network Model for Irony Detection in Twitter

## Methods
This model utilizes a simple neural network architecture of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with various input features, including:
- Lexical features
- Syntactic features
- Semantic features
- Polarity features

The model was developed for the **SemEval 2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets**. It was evaluated using two subtasks:
- **Subtask A**: Binary irony classification (ironic vs. non-ironic).
- **Subtask B**: Multi-class irony classification.

## Results
- The model achieved high performance in both binary and multi-class irony detection subtasks.
- It ranked **at least third** based on the accuracy metric and **fifth** using the F1 metric.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is from **SemEval 2018 Task 3** on **Irony Detection in English Tweets**.
- Specific details about the dataset (e.g., number of samples, distribution of classes) are not provided in the repository.
