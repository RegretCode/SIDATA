**URL**: [https://github.com/shamiulshifat/sarcasm-detector-on-news-headline-with-EDA-and-RNN](https://github.com/shamiulshifat/sarcasm-detector-on-news-headline-with-EDA-and-RNN)  

## Description  
This project focuses on **sarcasm detection in news headlines** using a **publicly available dataset**. The process involves **data preprocessing**, including:  
- **Cleaning the text**  
- **Word embedding**  

Following preprocessing, a **Bidirectional LSTM model** was developed to predict whether a given news headline is sarcastic or not.  

## Methods and Models  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**, including tokenization and word embeddings.  
- **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** for sarcasm classification.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project contains **news headlines labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic**.  

## Implementation Details  
The implementation includes:  
- **Data preprocessing** (cleaning and embedding)  
- **Feature engineering**  
- **Model training using BiLSTM**  
- **Evaluation of model performance**  

## Requirements  
The project is implemented in **Python** using deep learning libraries.  

## Results  
The model's performance is evaluated based on **classification accuracy**, but specific metrics are not provided in the repository.
