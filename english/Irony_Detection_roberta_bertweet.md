**Description**: Hyperparameter tuning of roberta and bertweet on irony detection dataset cardiffnlp/tweet_eval

## Methods
This repository focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of two pre-trained models, **RoBERTa** and **BERTweet**, for the task of irony detection. The models are fine-tuned on the **cardiffnlp/tweet_eval** dataset, which is designed for tweet-based sentiment and irony detection.

The primary method involves experimenting with different hyperparameters for both RoBERTa and BERTweet, evaluating their performance on the irony detection task.

## Results
The repository does not provide detailed results or metrics directly in the description. However, it is implied that the hyperparameter tuning process aims to improve the performance of RoBERTa and BERTweet on the irony detection dataset.

## Dataset
The repository uses the **cardiffnlp/tweet_eval** dataset, which contains annotated tweet data specifically designed for evaluating sentiment and irony detection models. The dataset is available for download from the Hugging Face dataset repository.
