# Sarcasm Detector  
**URL**: [https://github.com/benevanoff/Sarcasm-Detector](https://github.com/benevanoff/Sarcasm-Detector)  

## Description  
This project is an attempt at **sarcasm detection** using **prosodic cues** from the **SadBoyz Irony dataset**.  

## Methods and Models  
- **Prosodic Feature Analysis**: Investigates sarcasm detection through speech patterns and intonation.  
- **Dataset-Based Approach**: Utilizes the **SadBoyz Irony dataset**, which contains ironic and non-ironic speech samples.  

⚠ **Lack of Information**:  
- The repository does **not specify** which **machine learning or deep learning models** were used.  
- There is **no clear methodology** described regarding feature extraction, preprocessing, or training process.  

## Dataset  
- **SadBoyz Irony dataset**: A dataset designed for irony detection through **prosodic cues** (intonation, pitch, rhythm).  

## Implementation Details  
⚠ **Lack of Information**:  
- No implementation details are provided regarding **feature extraction, preprocessing, or classification models**.  

## Results  
⚠ **Lack of Information**:  
- The repository does **not provide** specific results, evaluation metrics, or performance comparisons.
