**Descrição**: This is the PyTorch implementation of work presented in 'Modelling Context with User Embeddings for Sarcasm Detection in Social Media' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00976.pdf). We further extend the approach by proposing a hybrid NN architecture and perform experiments on a newly collected data.
