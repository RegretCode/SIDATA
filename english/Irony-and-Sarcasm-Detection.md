**Description**: Trained a Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM layer) models to perform classification of Ironic and Sarcastic Tweets using Natural Language Processing. Pre-processing of the text data and word vectorisation was required before training these models using TensorFlow. Evaluated the models' performance based on Precision, Recall, and F-Scores. The sequential model produced accuracy over 90% for training, validation, and test datasets.

## Methods
- **Model Types**: Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning and word vectorization to convert text into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Training Framework**: TensorFlow was used for training both models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F-Scores.

## Results
- **Performance**: The sequential model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on training, validation, and test datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Detailed metrics include Precision, Recall, and F-Scores (specific values not mentioned, but the model is reported to perform well).

## Dataset
- **Dataset Type**: Dataset consists of tweets classified as ironic or sarcastic.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Required steps include text pre-processing and word vectorization to convert the text data into a usable format for the models.
