**Descrição**: Trained a Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM layer) models to perform classification of Ironic and Sarcastic Tweets using Natural Language Processing. Pre-processing of the text data and word vectorisation was required before training these models using TensorFlow. Evaluated the models' performance based on Precision, Recall, and F-Scores. The sequential model produced accuracy over 90% for training, validation, and test datasets.
