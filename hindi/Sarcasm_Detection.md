## Abstract

With the increasing use of social media, many new NLP challenges have emerged, including sarcasm detection. This study presents:  

- A corpus of tweets for training custom word embeddings.  
- A **Hinglish (Hindi-English code-mixed) dataset** labeled for sarcasm detection.  
- A **deep learning-based approach** leveraging bilingual word embeddings derived from **FastText** and **Word2Vec** techniques.  

### Models and Results

The study experimented with various deep learning models:  

- **CNNs**  
- **LSTMs**  
- **Bi-directional LSTMs (with and without attention)**  

The **attention-based Bi-directional LSTM** achieved the best performance, with an **accuracy of 78.49%**, outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.
